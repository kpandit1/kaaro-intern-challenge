# Kaaro Intern Coding Challenge
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Goal
For this challenge, you will mainly be working with the Comments component of this app. To complete the challenge
implement the following
1. Display the comments found in the database at `https://kaaro-intern-challenge.firebaseio.com/comments.json`. The comments should be formatted in the same way as the static comments. The commenter's username should link to `/users/username`  

2. Implement an add comment form. On pressing the enter key, the typed in comment should be added to the database and also be displayed alongside the other comments. For example, this is how you would post a comment through curl

```
curl -X POST -d '
  {
    "username": "luigi",
    "text": "Lets a go"
  }
' 'https://kaaro-intern-challenge.firebaseio.com/comments.json'
```

**HINT: Be sure to check out all the comments in the app code, they will give you hints on where to start!**
